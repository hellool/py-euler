# py-euler
This is a collection of solutions for various Project Euler problems, implemented in Python &amp; Cython. More interesting solutions may include additional documentation. If I decide to participate in the yearly Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com/) I will also include that code here. 

For the uninitiated: https://projecteuler.net/
Project Euler is a passion of mine since I love math, computer science and challenge programming. Since I have worked on and off on Project Euler since around 2011, most of the code I wrote is lost on various old personal and work PCs. I may decide to re-do at least the more interesting of the first ~100 problems with documentation since I've mostly forgotten how I solved them by now...

This repo is an effort to make sure that any future work I do for Project Euler is saved and in one place.

My code has few dependencies, but you will need a Python 3 environment with an up to date numpy package and ideally a decent processor & memory (even with the "right" solution, some solutions still deal with a combinatorially-large solution space, extremely large numbers or both, and can strain CPUs and/or memory in the worst cases.)
